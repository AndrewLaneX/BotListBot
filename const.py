It was built to simplify navigation and to automate the process of submitting, reviewing and adding bots to the @BotList by the @BotListChat community.

*Try it out:* Start off by using the /category command and use the available buttons from there on.
You can also send individual @BotList categories to your friends via inline search (i.e. type `@bot_list_bot music` in any chat).

If you want to check before /contributing, you can also send me the `@username` of a bot and I will see whether it exists in the @BotList.
Refer to the /examples if you want to submit a bot or set it as offline.
"""
CONTRIBUTING_MESSAGE = """You can use the following `#tag`s with a bot `@username` to contribute to the BotList:

‚Ä¢ #new ‚Äî Submit a fresh bot. Use üîé if it supports inline queries and flag emojis to denote the language. Everything after the `-` character can be your description of the bot (see /examples).
‚Ä¢ #offline ‚Äî Mark a bot as offline.

There are also the corresponding /new and /offline commands.

The moderators will approve your submission as soon as possible.

‚Ä¢ Wow! I found this nice #new bot: @coolbot üîéüáÆüáπ - Cools your drinks in the fridge.

It does not suffice the standards we impose for inclusion in the @BotList for one of the following reasons:

‚ñ´Ô∏èA better bot with the same functionality is already in the @BotList.
‚ñ´Ô∏èThe user interface is bad in terms of usability and/or simplicity.
‚ñ´Ô∏èContains ads or adult content
‚ñ´Ô∏èEnglish language not supported per default

For further information, please ask in the @BotListChat."""
