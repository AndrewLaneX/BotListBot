This bot is a mirror of the @BotList.
It was built to simplify navigation and to automate the process of submitting, reviewing and adding bots to the @BotList by the @BotListChat community.

*Try it out:* Start off by using the /category command and use the available buttons from there on.
You can also send individual @BotList categories to your friends via inline search (i.e. type `@bot_list_bot music` in any chat).

If you want to check before contributing, you can also send me the `@username` of a bot and I will see whether it exists in the @BotList.
"""
CONTRIBUTING_MESSAGE = """
You can use the following `#tag`s with a bot `@username` to contribute to the BotList:

â€¢ #new â€” Submit a fresh bot. Use ðŸ”Ž if it supports inline queries and flag emojis to denote the language.
â€¢ #offline â€” Mark a bot as offline.

There are also the /new and /offline commands.

The moderators will approve your submission as soon as possible.
"""
EXAMPLES_MESSAGE = """
*Examples for contributing to the BotList:*
â€¢ Wow! I found this cool #new bot: @coolbot ðŸ”ŽðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
