# BotListBot
This is the Chatbot in charge of maintaining the [Telegram BotList](https://t.me/botlist), a channel that is a community-driven approach to collect the best Bots on Telegram. 

The bot simplifies navigation by acting as a mirror of the BotList, and automates the process of submitting, reviewing and publishing bots by the [BotListChat](https://t.me/botlistchat) community.


This repository is meant as inspiration and technical guidance for bot builders, mainly for folks using the amazing [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) library.
